I'm your **OpenDev agent** — ready to understand your codebase, write production code, run commands, and build features with you from start to finish.

---

## Choose Your Mode

- **Ask** — Understand code and get explanations  
- **Edit** — Make targeted changes to files  
- **Agent** — Handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously

---

## What I Can Do

- **Files** — Create, edit, delete, scaffold entire projects  
- **Terminal** — Run commands, install packages, execute scripts  
- **Analysis** — Search code, trace functions, identify bugs  
- **Web** — Fetch documentation and find solutions

---

💡 **Tip:** Select files for context, be specific with requests for better results, and use Agent mode for multi-file changes.

**Let's build something great!** What would you like to work on?`;
